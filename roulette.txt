To start this assignment, I first made a function that would draw a card.  Then I would ask for the total money that the user has and tell them that there are only odd or even bets.  I also added a while function 
so that while 1 or 2 or 0, it would keep running.  I then asked to place a bet and odd or even.  I then used an if function for if they choose 1, 2, or 0.  If they chose 1, then they bet on odd and it would call the draw a number function.  If you won, it would add to your total and if you lost it would subtract.  If the money dipped below 0, the program automatically ends.  It then asks if you want to continue or leave the 
casino.  I then did the same for the even function and if they wanted to quit, it showed the amount they had and they leave the casino.
